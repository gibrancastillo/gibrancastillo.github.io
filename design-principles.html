            The Converse website makes use of the Hick's Law by helping users to
            filter in what they like and filter out what they do not according
            to their needs and wants thus increasing their decision-making on
            the things they really like and want.

            The Wix website makes use of the Fitt's Law by making their most
            importan buttons easily seen and accessible. As I navigate through
            the site, I know where I need to press to get started to use their
            product and services.

            The Adidas website make use of the Occam's Razor by simplicifying
            content in the viewport throughout the website; also the choice of
            typography with lots of space enhances this effect as well.
