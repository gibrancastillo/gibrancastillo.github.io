                    <em><b>What did I do since the last meeting?</b></em> <br>
                    I dived into week five immensely. I learned about HTML5 and JavaScript APIs made available in web browsers and I learned about functions, execution context, 
                    call stack, callbacks, and higher-order functions from Will Sentenceâ€™s YouTube videos. I worked on L09 Individual Activity, I completed L09 Readings, L10 Readings, 
                    and I completed my Trello Cards for the sleeping outside website. I helped the team JSON Web Token and Bearer token process. I am still excited about all the amazing 
                    things I have learned, I am learning, and I'll learn in the next three weeks left of this course regardless of my grade.
                    <br><br>
                    <em><b>What am I going to do next?</b></em> <br>
                    I am going to work on the Final Project Trello Cards and meet with my peers from Team 2 Monday/Wednesday night to work on the Final Project and divide up 
                    the work (Trello cards) we need to complete.
                    <br><br>
                    <em><b>What are my blockers?</b></em> <br>
                    My blocker is freeing up time to complete week six Trello Cards for the Final Project.
