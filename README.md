# WDD 230 Development Standards Checklist
The following list is modeled, in part, after [The Front-End Checklist](https://frontendchecklist.io/) by David Dias.
The references are to [MDN Web Docâ€”Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) sources.

## Overall
All folders and files follow the course naming rules which include lowercase only, no spaces, and are friendly or semantic.
Web Naming Rules and Standards
When working on the web, there are many things that affect the operation of the filesâ€”the browser, the protocol(s), the client and server operating systems, the language(s), etc. While many of these are out of your control, there are steps you can take to help keep things consistent. We label these steps and "best-practice" procedures as the web naming rules or naming conventions and should be applied to all files and folders in this class. Each organization may have their own guides and "best practices" as many of these items may be platform specific.

### 230 Rules for Naming Files and Folders
â–º Use all lowercase. Different platforms and systems handle case sensitivity differently.

â–º Do not use spaces in names. Spaces are interrupted obtusely by user agents, therefore, do not use them. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) ignores spaces, except in file names. In file names, it replaces a space with a symbolâ€”"%20." This makes URL's look confusing and can also lend itself to confusion in the mind of site visitors. Instead, if you have to create a visual space, use underscores (_) or hyphens (-).

â–º Do not use special characters (such as, <,>, \, /, #, ?, !). Special characters often mean specific things to computers, so just avoid using them completely in the naming of files and folders.

â–º Use as short and as meaningful (semantic) of names as possible. Short, meaningful names save you, other developers, and site visitors from having to remember long complicated names for files and folders. When meaningful, they also help with the predictive nature of the file or folder contents when working with those files or folders.

In this class, we will use some standard folder names for our sites/sub-folders:

CSS  (this folder will contain our CSS files
JS (this folder will contain our JavaScript files
Images (this folder will contain our images)
Reference: [Dealing With Files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files)â€”moz://a MDN web docs

Be kind and helpful to yourself and site visitors by following these simple rules. Also, be aware that for the class, you will be held accountable for doing so as this is part of the overall assessment criteria with deliverables.

ðŸŒ® Aside: Common Naming Conventions in Programming
  While not necessarily used for file and folder names these are the common naming casings are found in programming with source code. 
â€¢  Camel Caseâ€”each word within a compound word name is capitalized except for the first word.  Examples: julySales, getNewReport()
â€¢  Pascal Caseâ€”each word within a compound word name is capitalized.   Examples:  JulySales, GetNewReport()
â€¢  Underscore or Snake Caseâ€”each word within a compound word name is separated by underscores. Often found in file names but not preferred due to the fact that underlining will happen with hypertext by default, leading to confusion. Examples: july_sales, get_new_report(), soda_springs.html
â€¢  Kebab Caseâ€”all the letters are lower case and each word is separated by a hyphen or minus sign. Examples: july-sales, get-new-report(), soda-springs.html

No relevant violations of design principles of [alignment, proximity, contrast, repetition](https://byui.instructure.com/courses/10157/pages/w02-activity-design-principles), and usable typography.
The visual appearance of all pages in the site must be responsive, uniform, and consistent at three, basic view levels.
The page/site does not contain spelling and grammatical errors.


## Head
The following are correctly declared and used in the head section of all [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/html) pages.

â€¢ [Unique ID selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors)â€”if an ID selector is used, it is unique to a page (the planned use of [class selector](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) is preferred)
â€¢ All pages are tested for responsive web design with appropriately sized text, links, and no scrolling to the right nor deadspace.
â€¢ The CSS is not repeated or duplicated unnecessarily between views nor duplicated because of the use of non-congruent selectors nor left unused from the design and development cycle.
