                    What did I do since the last meeting? <br>
                    I dived into week one immensely. I created my sitepoint.com subscription through BYUI Bookstore, I copied the course Trello workspace 
                    into my own and granted access to my peers in team 2, I scheduled the two weekly team meetings, I helped my peers understand how Kanban 
                    boards and user stories work, I completed week one assignments, I attended Tuesday night office hours zoom meeting, and I am excited on 
                    all the amazing things I'll learn in this course regardless of my grade.
                    <br><br>
                    What am I going to do next? <br>
                    I am going to re-read chapters 12 and 15 of the JavaScript Novice To Ninja 2nd Edition book to make sure key concepts and JavaScript 
                    features sync in completely, I am going to meet with my peers in Team 2 Monday/Wednesday night to work on the team assignment and divide 
                    up the work (Trello cards) we need to complete for week 2.  Furthermore, I'll attend the course office hours Tuesday/Thursday night to get 
                    clarification on things that I need more understanding of.
                    <br><br>
                    What are my blockers? <br>
                    My blockers include an understanding of the JavaScript way of doing OOP and a vast list of features and ways of doing things with JavaScript. 
                    I need to better understand how SASS works and how to leverage NodeJS for development. And lastly, I need to pace myself so that I can be able 
                    to apply everything that I am learning in the JavaScript Novice To Ninja 2nd Edition book
