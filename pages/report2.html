                <p>
                    What did I do since the last meeting? <br>
                    I dived into week two immensely. I created <a href="../index.html">my personal GitHub page</a>
                    to report my progress, I worked on L03 Team Activity 2 with my peers in team 2, and I completed L03 Readings, L04 
                    Readings, and L04 Individual Activity 3. I helped my peers understand how to use ES Modules, I attended the Thursday 
                    night office hours zoom meeting, and I am still excited about all the amazing things I'll learn in this course regardless of my grade.
                    <br><br>
                    What am I going to do next? <br>
                    I am going to complete re-reading chapters 12 and 15 of the JavaScript Novice To Ninja 2nd Edition book to make sure key 
                    concepts and JavaScript features sync in completely, I am going to complete week two Trello cards, I am going to meet with 
                    my peers in Team 2 Monday/Wednesday night to work on the team assignment and divide up the work (Trello cards) we need to complete for the week 3.
                    <br><br>
                    What are my blockers?<br>
                    My blockers include not having a solid understanding of the JavaScript way of doing OOP and a vast list of features and ways 
                    of doing things with JavaScript. I need free up more time to complete week three assignments and be able to experiment more with what I am learning.
