                <p>
                    <em><b>What did I do since the last meeting?</b></em> <br>
                    I dived into week four immensely. I learned how the memorization, lazy definition patterns, JavaScript runtime (V8), WebAPIs, callback queue, closure, 
                    the event loop, and concurrency. I also learned how JSON Web Tokens work and the importance to learn as you develop and debug (on the job learning). 
                    I worked on L08 Team Activity 7 with my peers in team 2, and I completed L07 Readings, L08 Readings, and L07 Individual Activity 6, and worked with 
                    Jermain Lopez Andino to create the site plan for the Final Project proposal. I helped the team resolve the checkout form issue getting accepted and 
                    processed by the checkout API. I am still excited about all the amazing things I have learned, I am learning, and I'll learn in the next three weeks 
                    left of this course regardless of my grade.
                    <br><br>
                    <em><b>What am I going to do next?</b></em> <br>
                    I am going to work on the sleeping outside and Final Project Trello Cards and meet with my peers from Team 2 Monday/Wednesday night to work on the team 
                    assignment and divide up the work (Trello cards) we need to complete for the week 5.
                    <br><br>
                    <em><b>What are my blockers?</b></em> <br>
                    My blockers include not having a solid understanding of creating animation using CSS and JavaScript. I need free up more time to complete week five 
                    assignments and be able to experiment more with what I am learning.
